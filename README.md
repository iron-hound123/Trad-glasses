## Structure
This repository is structured as follows:

- `backend/`: This directory contains the backend code of the Trad-glasses project implemented in Python. The mobile app development with Flutter in Dart. MediaPipe (for gesture detection and hand tracking).
- `frontend/`: Here, you will find the frontend code with Flutter (for building the mobile app)
- `models/`: This directory contains the trained Generative AI models used by YoungSlover (Tensorflow Lite)
- `bot/`: This directory contains the source code for the telegram bot to make it usable from within telegram groups or chat with the telegram bot.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for development and improvement of the Trad-glasses project. By making the repository publicly accessible, we aim to foster community engagement, allowing developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest enhancements.

## How Generative AI Models Power Afrochat
YoungSlover use the integration of AI model to different services (GPT) To turn gestures into coherent sentences. Key features include:

- Gesture detection
- Transform sign language into text
- Combine generative AI with output text to generate a better translation of sign language
- Generate sound from text
